# Among The Beat

Created in collobration with: **Khurram Hanif**, **Joshua Daniel Canta**, **Zheming(Jason) Hu**

Among The Beat uses the MERN stack to create a spotify-like interface with a twist. We wanted to showcase what the music you listen to tell us about you. We used Spotify API to create a online webplayer as well as used their analytics API to get details about the song you listen to such as danceability, major/minor scale, tone etc. to draw a canvas that represents your current mood.
